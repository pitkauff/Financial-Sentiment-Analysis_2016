# Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project was part of TO 412 - Big DataTools for Data Management and Acquisition at The Ross School of Business.

**Problem Statement**

This project attempts to identify whether or not sentiment as expressed over social media (via sides such as Twitter or Facebook) can have an economic effect on a company. Specifically, we focused on analyzing the impact of tweets on Tesla's (TSLA) stock price. Tesla was being identified as an event driven company as well as a "sensation" stock, i.e. a security that is closely watched by the public for numerous reasons.
